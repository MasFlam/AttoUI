# AttoUI â€“ minimalistic UI toolkit for Wayland
AttoUI is library that makes creating GUI programs for Wayland in C as simple and bloatless as
it can. There is no GObject-like OOP ersatz, and no GLib-like main loop/IO layer. Look at the
programs in [`example/`](./example) to get a grip of how to use it, and refer to the header file
for more detailed info. There are no man pages yet, but that'll change. It's also GPL-licensed
for ultimate freedom.
